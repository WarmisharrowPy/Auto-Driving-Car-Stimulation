# Auto-Driving-Car-Stimulation
Auto Driving Car Stimulation With Pygame Module.

**I prefer to use Pycharm IDE**

**Installation**

**For windows users**

(run those in command prompt/cmt/terminal) For automating car `pip install pygame`

**For linux users**

Learn all the above commands on terminal. Make sure to use `pip3`, because in linux `pip` refers for python2 and `pip3` refers to python3. Install these too - `pip3 install pygame`
